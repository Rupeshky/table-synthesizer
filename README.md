### Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Synthetic Data Generation
This repository contains Python code for training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model on tabular data and generating synthetic data using the trained model. The synthetic data can be used for various purposes such as data augmentation, privacy-preserving data sharing, and model testing.
