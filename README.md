# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Synthetic Data Generation

Welcome to my project! This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to generate synthetic data using two powerful techniques: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

## Overview:

This project provides two scripts:
1. ### 'vae_synthetic_data_generation.py':
2. This script trains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on your dataset to generate synthetic data.
3. ### "gan_synthetic_data_generation.py":
4. This script uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic data that closely resembles your original dataset.

#### i. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install a few Python packages. Don't worry, it's easy! Just open your command prompt or terminal and type: 

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow

#### ii. Get Started:
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Put your dataset in CSV format in the same folder as the Python script.
- Open the script vae_synthetic_data_generation.py and replace 'adult.csv' with the name of your dataset.
- Run the script by double-clicking on it or typing python vae_synthetic_data_generation.py in your command prompt or terminal.

#### What Happens Next:
- The script will train the VAE model on your data.
- Once training is done, it will generate synthetic data.
- The synthetic data will be saved in a file named synthetic_data.csv.

### Why Use This:

- Need more data for your project? Generate synthetic data easily!
- Want to protect sensitive information in your dataset? Use synthetic data instead!
- Curious about machine learning? This project is a great way to get started!
