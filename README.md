# Table synthesis using VAE and GAN
## 1. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Synthetic Data Generation
Welcome to my project! This is a simple Python code that trains a special type of neural network called a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on your data and generates new data that looks similar to your original dataset.

### How to Use:

#### i. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install a few Python packages. Don't worry, it's easy! Just open your command prompt or terminal and type: 

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow

#### ii. Get Started:
- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Put your dataset in CSV format in the same folder as the Python script.
- Open the script vae_synthetic_data_generation.py and replace 'adult.csv' with the name of your dataset.
- Run the script by double-clicking on it or typing python vae_synthetic_data_generation.py in your command prompt or terminal.

#### What Happens Next:
- The script will train the VAE model on your data.
- Once training is done, it will generate synthetic data.
- The synthetic data will be saved in a file named synthetic_data.csv.
